This project was made for the Avans University assignment '_PM&SWE 190315_'. The goal of this application is to learn how to apply several project planning standards to a simulated 'real-life' work environment, with the product and process adapting as the requirements changed during the planning and development of the project. 

The final product is a simple Android app which uses [The Movie Database](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) as its main API, and [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/) as it's main database.

This product was built and delivered by the following group of five AE&I students : 

> [Guus Lieben](https://github.com/guuslieben/) (Project manager / lead back-end)

> [Stijn Schep](https://github.com/StijnSchep) (Secretary / lead front-end)

> [Lars Akkermans](https://github.com/akkermans99)

> [Romano Keereweer](https://github.com/romanokeereweer)

> [Halil Erdemir](https://github.com/HIErdemir)
